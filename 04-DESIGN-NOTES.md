## 1. Project Overview

**RibbonKit** is an open-source (MIT) WPF custom control library recreating the Office
Fluent UI Ribbon on modern .NET.

Locked decisions:

- **Targets `net8.0-windows` and `net9.0-windows` only.** No .NET Framework support.
- Open source, packaged for NuGet (`RibbonKit`, currently `0.1.0-alpha.1`).
- Planning docs live in `docs/` inside the repo.
- Sample app: `samples/RibbonKit.Showcase` (a Word-like demo window).

Repo layout:

```
src/RibbonKit/
  Animation/       RibbonAnimation.cs (config), RibbonMotion.cs (transitions)
  Automation/      UIA peers (aliased: WPF's legacy ribbon has same-named peers)
  Controls/        All lookless controls (Ribbon, tabs, buttons, galleries, backstage, KeyTips, QAT)
  Interop/         MicaHelper.cs (DWM system backdrop)
  Layout/          Adaptive sizing engine (RibbonGroupsPanel, ReductionAlgorithm, RibbonSizeDefinition)
  Themes/          Generic.xaml, Office2024.xaml (ALL templates), Tokens.Office{2024,2019,2013}.xaml

```

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 One template set, token-driven themes

- **All control templates live in `Themes/Office2024.xaml`** (~1900 lines), shared by
  every theme. Templates never hardcode colors/metrics — they reference tokens via
  `DynamicResource` (`RibbonKit.Brushes.*`, `RibbonKit.Metrics.*`, `RibbonKit.Effects.*`).
- **Per-theme values** live in `Tokens.Office2024.xaml`, `Tokens.Office2019.xaml`,
  `Tokens.Office2013.xaml`. Same keys, different values. A theme "chooses" a visual
  style by zeroing what it doesn't use (e.g. flat themes set underline brushes to
  `Transparent`, corner radii to `0`, `ContextualUnderlineHeight` to `0`).
- The app merges one token dictionary into `Application.Resources` (App.xaml), and
  `ThemeManager.Apply` swaps it at runtime.

Theme identities:

- **Office2024** (default): light, rounded "floating card" ribbon body with shadow,
  accent underline tab selection.
- **Office2019** ("modern grey"): flat, grey band (`#E6E6E6`) behind tabs, white body,
  fill/pill tab selection. When the colored-title-bar toggle is ON the band + title bar
  turn accent-colored with white text.
- **Office2013** ("White"): fully flat/square, white strip, outlined active tab that
  cuts into the body, SOLID accent File button, tabs flush to the title bar.

### 2.2 ThemeManager (`Theming/ThemeManager.cs`)

- `Apply(app, theme)` swaps the merged token dictionary.
- **Runtime overrides layer on top by setting keys directly on `Application.Resources`**
  — own-dictionary entries beat merged dictionaries, and `DynamicResource` picks up the
  change live. Always *clear all override keys first*, then re-derive (prevents leaking
  a 2024 underline onto flat 2019, etc.).
- `SetAccent(app, color)`: derives a full accent family via `Mix()` (blend toward
  white/black). **Theme-aware**: only overrides tokens that theme actually uses.
- `SetAccentedTitleBar(app, bool)`: colors the title bar; in 2019 also the tab-strip
  band, hovers, and foregrounds. **Order matters**: it re-runs `ApplyAccentOverrides`
  first because the accent system owns `ApplicationButton.HoverBackground` for 2013.
- `Changed` static event fires after every Apply/SetAccent/ClearAccent/SetAccentedTitleBar
  — the Ribbon listens to re-evaluate QAT icon tinting.
- `IsAccentedTitleBar`, `CurrentTheme` are queryable statics.

### 2.3 Window chrome (`Controls/RibbonWindow.cs`)

- Custom chrome via `WindowChrome` (`CaptionHeight=34`, `UseAeroCaptionButtons=False`),
  themed caption buttons, a `TitleBarContent` slot (used by the title-bar QAT).
- **Maximize overhang fix (important)**: a maximized WindowChrome window hangs past the
  monitor work area. `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` hooks did NOT fix it reliably. The working fix
  is *measured margin compensation*: on state/DPI changes, measure `GetWindowRect` vs
  `MonitorFromWindow`/`GetMonitorInfo.rcWork`, convert device px → DIP via
  `VisualTreeHelper.GetDpi`, and inset `PART_WindowRoot` by exactly that margin.
- The template intentionally had **no `GlassFrameThickness="-1"`** (it broke maximize
  before the measured fix); Mica later required extending glass — see §3.10.

## 3. Implemented Features (chronological, with pitfalls)

### 3.1 Core ribbon skeleton
Tabs/groups/buttons (`RibbonButton`, `RibbonToggleButton`, `RibbonSplitButton`,
`RibbonDropDownButton`, `RibbonComboBox`), adaptive sizing engine
(Large→Medium→Small→Collapsed by `ReductionPriority`, `ReductionMode`, `CanResize`;
`SizeDefinition="Large, Medium, Small"` strings), collapsed-group flyouts that re-home
the group's content grid into a popup, galleries with live preview
(`RibbonGallery`/`InRibbonGallery` share ONE items presenter re-homed between strip and
popup — re-homing is driven by the *property* change, never Popup.Closed, which is
unreliable for nested popups), backstage overlay, ScreenTips, QAT, minimize, UIA peers.

**Popup pattern used everywhere**: `StaysOpen=True` + custom `PopupDismissHelper` for
light-dismiss, so WPF popup mouse-capture never steals the opener toggle's clicks.

### 3.2 Minimized QAT card (2024)
When minimized with QAT below, the extender becomes a floating card: token trio
`QatExtenderMargin/BorderThickness/CornerRadius` + `*Minimized` variants; flat themes
point both at the same values so nothing changes shape.

### 3.3 KeyTips (Alt / F10)
`KeyTip.cs` (attached props: `KeyTip.Keys`, auto-derivation from headers),
`KeyTipAdorner.cs` (badge visuals via theme tokens), `KeyTipService.cs` (state machine).

- Badges render in **per-target `AdornerLayer`s** — popups need their own
  `AdornerDecorator` inside the popup template (dropdown/split menu hosts + group
  flyout popup all have one).
- Levels: root (tabs + QAT + File) → tab level (groups' controls) → menu levels.
  Split buttons badge primary and chevron separately; collapsed groups badge the
  collapsed button then descend into the opened flyout; dialog launchers, gallery
  expanders, and backstage items are all badged.
- **Bug fixed**: pressing Alt while the backstage was open showed ribbon KeyTips —
  `Enter()` now builds a backstage-level when `_ribbon.IsBackstageOpen` (and doesn't
  close a mouse-opened backstage on exit).
- Invocation goes through UIA patterns (Invoke/Toggle) so it works for every control.

### 3.4 Contextual tabs = custom coloring (no marker line)
`RibbonTab.ContextualColor` (Brush) + read-only `ContextualBrush` (falls back to theme
accent). The old *upper marker line was removed*. Template has TWO header presenters
(`HeaderText` / tinted `ContextualHeaderText`) and a tinted
`ContextualSelectionIndicator` underline.

- 2024: tinted text dimmed via `ContextualUnselectedOpacity=0.6` until selected;
  selected = full tint + tinted underline (normal accent underline hidden).
- 2019/2013: tinted text only (`ContextualUnderlineHeight=0`, opacity 1).
- Showcase: PictureFormatTab uses `ContextualColor="#C43E96"`, shown by the Insert
  Picture toggle.

### 3.5 Colored title bar + accent customization
Showcase View tab has a "Colored Title Bar" toggle and an accent gallery (swatches with
hex `Tag`, "Auto" resets). All accents derive from ONE color via `SetAccent`.

### 3.6 2019 modernization & hover consistency
2019 recolored grey/white (`Ribbon.Background=#E6E6E6`, white selected tab/body). The
band **tracks the colored-title-bar toggle** (accent when on, grey when off). File
button + minimize toggle hover on the colored strip use the
`TabStrip.ControlHoverBackground` token synced to `Tab.HoverBackground` — but do NOT
unconditionally clear `ApplicationButton.HoverBackground`; the 2013 accent system owns
it (only set in the 2019 branch, after re-running accent overrides).

### 3.7 Large-button label alignment
Multi-line labels made buttons uneven. Fix: all four large layouts
(button/toggle/dropdown/split) use `Margin="6,8,6,0"` (icons top-anchored ~10px down)
+ label `MinHeight="32"` (reserves 2 lines) + `GroupsRowHeight` 96→104. Do NOT
vertically center large content — icons must line up across the row.

### 3.8 QAT placement (TitleBar / TabRow / BelowRibbon) + context menu
`RibbonQuickAccessPosition.TitleBar` added. Right-click context menu (3 placements,
check on current) attached to all three hosts.

- **`QatTabRowHost` lives in the nested RibbonTabControl template** — NOT reachable via
  the Ribbon's `GetTemplateChild`. Find it with a visual-tree search in `OnLoaded`.
- **Single-parent reparenting rule**: exactly ONE host binds `ItemsSource` at a time.
  Leaving the title bar releases synchronously; the new claim is deferred via
  `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(Background)` so the old host frees the items past a layout
  pass first (avoids transient double-parent exceptions).
- Title-bar host is code-created (`ItemsControl` + horizontal StackPanel), projected
  into `RibbonWindow.TitleBarContent`; previous content is saved/restored.

### 3.9 QAT white icons on colored surfaces
When the QAT sits on an accent surface (title bar with colored-title-bar ON, or 2019
tab row with colored band), icons turn white silhouettes and hover matches the band.

- **Inherited attached properties DID NOT propagate** to the QAT buttons across the
  ItemsControl/reparenting boundary — that approach failed. The working model is
  **direct-set**: `Ribbon.QatOnColoredSurface` (bool) + `Ribbon.QatHoverBackground`
  (brush, set via `SetResourceReference` to the neighbouring chrome's hover token) are
  set *on each item* in `UpdateQatButtonContext()`, re-run on `ThemeManager.Changed`,
  collection changes, and placement changes.
- White icon = `Rectangle Fill=#FFFFFF` with `OpacityMask=ImageBrush(Icon)`; the small
  layout has `SmallImage` + hidden `SmallImageTint`, swapped by template trigger.

### 3.10 Animation system (global + per-action)
**Configuration model chosen by user: global level + per-action overrides, default
Subtle.**

- `Animation/RibbonAnimation.cs`: `GlobalLevel` (`None/Subtle/Expressive`),
  `SetActionLevel/ClearActionLevel` per `RibbonAnimationAction` (12 actions:
  RibbonMinimize, Backstage, TabMarker, TabSwitch, Gallery, DropdownMenu, Hover,
  QuickAccessMove, ContextualTab, KeyTip, ToggleState, ThemeSwitch).
  `RespectSystemReduceMotion` (default true) → effective level None when
  `SystemParameters.ClientAreaAnimation` is off. Per-action durations (Subtle ~90–220ms;
  Expressive ×1.4) and slide offsets (Expressive ×1.8); easing CubicOut, Expressive gets
  BackEase on marker/QAT/KeyTip/Toggle. `Initialize(app)` publishes
  `RibbonKit.Animation.Duration.*` Duration tokens for template storyboards.
- `Animation/RibbonMotion.cs`: `PlayOpen` (fade+slide from an edge), `PlayClose`
  (fade+slide out, with completion callback), `PlaySlideIn` (slide WITHOUT opacity),
  `PlayFadeIn`, `AnimateTranslateY` (translate-only glide), `Rest`.

**Hard rules learned:**

1. **Never animate layout properties** (Width/Height/Margin) — transforms + opacity only.
2. **Never fade an element that's already rendered opaque** — resetting it to 0 first
   reads as a flicker. This killed the QAT-move cross-fade (removed) and changed tab
   switch to slide-only (`PlaySlideIn`).
3. **Never transform a Popup's direct child** — the transparent popup positions itself
   from that child's bounds, so a start offset bakes into the popup's resting position
   (the gallery "dropped a few pixels"). Animate the child's *inner content*.
4. Minimize/restore: the body's Visibility is **code-managed** (template trigger
   removed) — slide up + fade out, collapse row in the Completed callback; restore
   shows the row then slides down. Row height itself is never animated.
5. The below-ribbon QAT bar **glides with the body** on minimize/restore via
   `AnimateTranslateY(±bodyHeight)` (body height captured while visible), staying
   visible; transform resets in the same step as the collapse so it looks stationary.
6. Backstage: slide-in from LEFT on open; slide-out LEFT on close with the adorner
   removed in the Completed callback (`_backstageClosing` guard; re-open mid-close
   reuses the existing adorner — a UIElement can't have two).
7. Tab switch: slide from **Top** (content drops down away from the tab strip — user
   preference).

Wired so far: dropdown/split/flyout menus, gallery expand, backstage open/close, ribbon
minimize/restore (+QAT glide), tab-switch slide. **Not yet wired**: hover cross-fade,
true sliding tab marker (current = content slide; the underline doesn't glide between
tabs yet), contextual-tab appear, KeyTip pop, toggle-state, theme-switch fade.
Showcase: View → Motion group (None/Subtle/Expressive + Respect System toggle);
`App.xaml.cs` calls `RibbonAnimation.Initialize(this)`.

### 3.11 Backstage redesign (Modern 2024) + icons
`RibbonBackstageDesign` enum (`Classic`/`Modern`); `Backstage.Design` is an **inherited
attached property** so nav items restyle from one setting (this inheritance works
because backstage items are direct logical children — unlike the QAT case in §3.9).

- Modern: light rail `#F5F4F3` (width 200 vs classic 220), dark text, rounded inset
  item highlights, selected = light fill + 3px accent left bar + accent text.
- Classic (default): the original accent column, untouched — backward compatible.
- The back button tints via `TemplateBinding Foreground` with a foreground-tinted
  hover disc (works on both designs).
- `BackstageTabItem.Icon` (ImageSource): rendered as a **foreground-tinted silhouette**
  (Rectangle + OpacityMask) in an always-reserved 16px column → icon-less items stay
  aligned. Selected item's icon goes accent automatically.
- **Modern.* brushes use `StaticResource`** — they're defined inside Office2024.xaml
  itself; DynamicResource lookup from a template can't reliably find theme-dictionary
  locals (only app-scope tokens). Accent-driven parts stay DynamicResource.
- Trigger order matters: Modern trigger first, then Translucent triggers (later wins).
- Showcase: `Design="Modern"` default, Home/Info/New/Open items (Info deliberately has
  no icon to demo alignment), View → Backstage group toggle.

### 3.12 Mica (Windows 11 system backdrop) — EXPERIMENTAL
`Interop/MicaHelper.cs`: `TrySetBackdrop(window, RibbonBackdrop)` sets
`DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE` (38); `None/Mica/Acrylic/Tabbed`; requires build ≥22621
(`IsSupported`), returns false otherwise (toggle self-reverts).

- **Black-background pitfall (real bug we hit)**: the backdrop only composites where
  the DWM glass frame reaches. Our chrome has no glass → transparent window rendered
  BLACK. Fix: `ExtendGlassFrame(window, full)` swaps in a WindowChrome clone with
  `GlassFrameThickness = -1` (or 0 to restore), preserving caption/resize settings.
  Uses WindowChrome (not raw `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea`) so it survives WPF's
  chrome re-application.
- `Backstage.Translucent` (bool): transparent root + semi-transparent content
  (`#E6FFFFFF`) and modern nav (`#CCF5F4F3`) so Mica shows through the backstage.
  **No longer used by the showcase** — see the backstage-opaque decision below.
- Showcase Mica toggle: backdrop + glass + transparent Window/MainContentArea
  backgrounds; all restored on un-toggle.

**Glass-frame-on-un-toggle pitfall (real bug we hit):** turning Mica OFF used to call
`ExtendGlassFrame(false)`, collapsing `GlassFrameThickness` to `0` — which **destroyed the
window border and Windows 11 rounded corners**. Cause: the RibbonWindow template keeps
`GlassFrameThickness="-1"` as its resting state, and on a WindowChrome window (native NC
frame stripped) that extended glass is the *only* thing the DWM has to draw the border and
rounded corners. Collapsing to `0` removes them. (It only became visible after we added the
`WS_SYSMENU` toggle's `SWP_FRAMECHANGED`, which forces the frame to recompute.) Fix: on
Mica-off, **leave the glass extended** (don't call `ExtendGlassFrame(false)`) — the opaque
window background is enough to avoid the black-background problem. `ExtendGlassFrame`'s
remarks now warn about the `false`/`0` case.

**Title-bar-through-Mica (added this session):** the title bar can go transparent so
Mica composites through it, but *only* in the case where a solid bar isn't wanted:
Office 2024 **and** the title bar is not colored. Rules: 2024 + non-colored →
transparent (Mica); any other theme + non-colored → keep the theme's light grey/white
band; colored title bar (any theme) → keep the accent. This lives in
`ThemeManager.SetTitleBarBackdrop(app, bool)` / `IsTitleBarBackdrop`, which sets/clears a
transparent `TitleBar.Background` override inside `ApplyTitleBarOverride`. Because that
method runs on every `Apply`/accent/accent-title-bar change, the transparency is
**re-derived on theme switch** — fixing the earlier bug where changing theme reverted the
title bar to a solid color instead of staying transparent. Caption foreground/hover are
left at their theme defaults (dark text + light hover), which read fine over the material.

**Native caption buttons pitfall (real bug we hit):** with the glass frame extended
(`-1`), a *transparent* title bar let the DWM's own min/max/close buttons show through and
overlap our custom caption buttons (they were previously just covered by the opaque bar).
Fix: `MicaHelper.ShowNativeCaptionButtons(window, bool)` strips/restores `WS_SYSMENU` via
`SetWindowLong(GWL_STYLE)` + `SetWindowPos(SWP_FRAMECHANGED)`. Chosen over
`WindowStyle="None"` deliberately: it's surgical (leaves `WindowStyle` =
`SingleBorderWindow`, so all the tuned maximize/snap/work-area handling is unchanged) and
it toggles **live** with no HWND recreation — which `WindowStyle` can't do. Trade-off:
Alt+Space system menu + window-icon menu are gone while it's off (fine for a fully
custom-chrome window). Toggled in sync with the Mica on/off state.

**Backstage stays opaque under Mica (decision this session):** the modern
`Translucent` effect didn't read well over Mica, so the showcase no longer enables it.
An opaque backstage fully covers the content behind it, so Mica shows only in the title
bar / ribbon chrome, never bleeding through the backstage page. (`Backstage.Translucent`
is kept as a library API, just unused by the sample.)

- **VERIFIED on real hardware (user-confirmed):** maximize with Mica ON stays inside the
  work area (the measured compensation absorbs the glass overhang); native caption buttons
  are gone with a transparent bar; a theme switch keeps the bar transparent; and the
  colored-title-bar toggle flips 2024 back to an opaque accent bar. Only remaining Mica idea
  is a future one: dark-mode-aware translucency.

### 3.13 UI polish fixes

- **Gallery scroll-to-chosen-item: ATTEMPTED, then REVERTED (known-good restored).** The
  idea: committing a pick in an `InRibbonGallery`'s expanded popup would close the popup
  (Office-style) and scroll the single-row strip to the selected tile so you'd see the pick
  once the popup was gone. It was implemented via `OnSelectionChanged` (deferred close) +
  a `ScrollSelectedItemIntoView` on close. **It repeatedly broke popup hit-testing** and was
  backed out — `InRibbonGallery.cs` is now the original pre-feature version.
  - **Why it's fragile (for whoever retries this):** the strip and the popup share ONE
    `ScrollViewer` that re-homes between them. Scrolling that scroller for the strip (whose
    viewport is a single ~54px row) leaves it in a state that corrupts the popup's
    hit-testing when the same scroller is re-homed there. Symptoms walked through three
    forms: (1) selecting the tile *below* the clicked one (leftover vertical offset carried
    into the popup — clicks off by exactly the offset, clamped at the ends); (2) after adding
    `ScrollToVerticalOffset(0)` on open, a *scale-like* miss where only the top row selected
    correctly and everything lower clamped to the last item (the scroller's **viewport was
    stale** right after the re-home — top row hit-tests, everything past the stale viewport
    clamps to the bottom). Rendering stayed correct throughout, so it *looked* like a DPI
    scale bug but wasn't (it worked at the same DPI before the feature).
  - **If retried:** don't scroll the shared re-homed scroller. Give the popup its **own**
    items presenter (don't re-home), or reset/relayout on the popup's `Opened` event once the
    content is actually laid out — not synchronously right after the re-home.
- **Tab underline hover flicker (2024) fixed.** The hover trigger is scoped to
  `SourceName="HeaderChrome"`, but the three indicator rectangles (`HoverIndicator`,
  `SelectionIndicator`, `ContextualSelectionIndicator`) are *siblings* overlaying it. A
  hit-testable underline stole the mouse from HeaderChrome → `IsMouseOver` dropped → the
  underline hid → the hit fell back to HeaderChrome → repeat = flicker (only on the
  hover underline; the active tab has no hover state so it never flickered). Fix:
  `IsHitTestVisible="False"` on all three indicators. The File button was immune because
  its trigger uses the button's own `IsMouseOver` and its underline is a descendant.
- **ComboBox height.** The input box had no min height, collapsing to the text height.
  Added `MinHeight="24"` to the input `Grid` in the `RibbonComboBox` template.
- **Showcase content area → document editor.** The centered instruction StackPanel was
  replaced with a Word-like layout: a `Border` "panel" with rounded TOP corners
  (`CornerRadius="8,8,0,0"`, square bottom meeting the status bar) hosting an editable
  `RichTextBox` (`DocumentEditor`, borderless/transparent so the panel supplies the card
  look), plus a `StatusBar` docked at the bottom (DockPanel items panel so left cluster and
  right zoom split to the edges). The same instruction text now lives in the RichTextBox's
  `FlowDocument`. **Live-preview wiring note:** the preview sentence is a named `Run`
  (`x:Name="StylePreviewText"`) inside the document — `Run` exposes the same
  `FontSize/FontWeight/FontStyle/Foreground` the old `TextBlock` did, so `ApplyStyleToSample`
  in the code-behind kept working unchanged (just retargeted from a TextBlock to a Run).

### 3.14 XAML design-time preview (active tab + backstage)

Goal: see a specific tab's content — and the backstage — on the XAML designer surface
instead of guessing. Two mechanisms, both driven by the developer's design-time `d:` attrs.

- **Active tab.** Added `Ribbon.SelectedIndex` (int, two-way, mirrored with `SelectedTab`
  via `OnSelectedTabChanged`/`OnSelectedIndexChanged` behind a `_syncingSelection` guard).
  It's a real runtime API too, but its point here is design-time: `d:SelectedIndex="2"`
  previews the third tab's groups on the surface without touching runtime selection.
  Timing: a `SelectedIndex` set before the child tabs are parsed (or a `d:` value applied
  during tree construction) is re-applied by `OnTabsCollectionChanged` and honored by
  `EnsureSelection`, so it lands once the tabs exist.
- **Backstage.** The runtime overlay is a `BackstageAdorner` added to **the window's**
  adorner layer via `Window.GetWindow(this)` — which is null in the designer, so the
  overlay silently no-ops and nothing shows. Fix: a design-mode-only path. The Ribbon
  template carries a normally-Collapsed `PART_DesignBackstageHost` (`Border`,
  `Grid.RowSpan="2"`, `MinHeight="440"`); `UpdateBackstageOverlay` checks
  `DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignMode` and, when true, hosts the `Backstage` element in
  that border (no window, no adorner, no animation) instead of the adorner. `OnApplyTemplate`
  reflects `IsBackstageOpen` into it once the host exists. Runtime is untouched (the design
  host stays Collapsed/empty). Preview it with `d:IsBackstageOpen="True"`. Note: the design
  host lives inside the ribbon, so the preview covers the ribbon's area (not the whole
  window) — enough to see/edit backstage content. **Needs verification in VS/Blend** (can't
  drive the designer from the build box); `d:` honoring and design-surface rendering are the
  two things to confirm there.

### 3.15 QAT customization + extensible options dialog (Word-Options style)

Goal: Office-style customization — right-click "Add to Quick Access Toolbar", a QAT
customize page, and ONE extensible options dialog the app can merge its own pages into
(so RibbonKit's customization pages and the app's options live together, like Word).

- **`RibbonOptionsDialog`** (`Controls/RibbonOptionsDialog.cs`): a lookless `Window` —
  custom white title bar (see below) + left nav rail of `Pages` + selected page content +
  OK/Cancel. `RibbonOptionsPage : HeaderedContentControl` is one page; its `Content` can be
  ANY element, including app user controls — that's the extensibility. **Key template
  trick:** the page control's own template renders ONLY its Header (it *is* the nav entry,
  hosted in `PART_PageList`), while the dialog presents `SelectedPage.Content` separately —
  this avoids the element ever having two visual parents. Result flow: OK raises
  **`Applied`** (the app's persist cue, per user's "dialog result event" requirement) then
  sets `DialogResult=true`; Cancel → `false`. Styles ride theme tokens; rail brush is a
  local static (Modern-backstage precedent).
  - **Chrome + layout (user-refined):** `WindowStyle=None` + `WindowChrome`
    (`CaptionHeight=34`, `ResizeBorderThickness=SystemParameters.WindowResizeBorderThickness`)
    + `ResizeMode=CanResize` → the dialog draws its OWN white title bar: `Title` text left
    (no icon), a single Close button right (`PART_CloseButton`, reuses the RibbonWindow
    close-glyph/red-hover; no min/max — a modal needs none). Close = Cancel (no `Applied`).
    **Rounded corners:** a `WindowStyle=None` window doesn't get Win11 rounding for free, so
    `MicaHelper.SetRoundedCorners` (new; `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE=ROUND` +
    `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR`) is called from `OnSourceInitialized`; the template therefore keeps
    `WindowChrome CornerRadius=0` and NO root border (the DWM draws the rounded border — a
    square one would fight it). Win10 (< build 22000) is a no-op (square, as it would be
    anyway). Layout: outer 2-row grid (title bar | body); body is 2 rows (rail+page | button
    bar), so the nav **rail spans only the rail+page row** and ends where the content does —
    the button bar is full width beneath both.
  - **Scroll policy (user-refined) — per-page via `IRibbonFillPage`:** the page content is
    hosted in a ScrollViewer (`PART_ContentScroll`) whose `VerticalScrollBarVisibility` the
    dialog sets in code (`UpdateContentScrollMode`, on `SelectedPage` change / `OnApplyTemplate`):
    `Disabled` when `SelectedPage.Content` is an **`IRibbonFillPage`**, else `Auto`. A ScrollViewer
    with vertical scroll *Disabled* measures its content with the finite viewport height (not
    infinity), so a Stretch control FILLS it — that's how `RibbonQuickAccessPage` (which
    implements `IRibbonFillPage`) fills the content area while its own two ListBoxes scroll
    internally; the dialog scrollbar never appears for it. Any other page keeps `Auto`, so tall
    app content scrolls in the dialog (convenient default). Extensible: a user page can implement
    `IRibbonFillPage` to fill too.
    **Dead ends we tried first:** no-scroll + a fixed `MinHeight` (magic number); then a
    ScrollViewer + `MaxHeight`=viewport (only *caps*, so inside the infinite-height ScrollViewer
    the page shrank to content and floated short/centered); then `Height`=`ViewportHeight` binding
    (fragile). The Disabled-scroll approach needs no page-height binding at all.
- **QAT proxies (`Ribbon.AddToQuickAccess`)**: a WPF element has ONE visual parent, so
  adding a ribbon control to the QAT creates a small PROXY button mirroring its 16px
  icon/ScreenTip. Invocation reuses `KeyTipService.InvokeControl` (now `internal` static) —
  the UIA Invoke/Toggle path KeyTips already use, so split buttons invoke their PRIMARY via
  their automation peer. Toggles instead get a **two-way `IsChecked` binding** to the source
  (state lives on the source; both stay in sync; source Checked/Unchecked handlers run).
  Proxies carry the readonly attached `Ribbon.QuickAccessSource` so Remove/duplicate-check/
  dialog can map proxy → source (`IsInQuickAccess` checks both identity and source).
  **v1 limitation:** a dropdown proxy opens the source's popup at the *ribbon* location, not
  at the QAT. Combos/galleries aren't offered as candidates.
- **`RibbonQuickAccessPage`** (`Controls/RibbonQuickAccessPage.cs`): the built-in customize
  page — available commands (left; flattened from `Tabs→Groups→logical descendants`, since
  groups host arbitrary panels; depth-capped, popup content never reached because those
  types aren't descended into) | Add/Remove/Up/Down | current QAT (right). Display via
  `RibbonCommandEntry` wrappers ("Home › Font › Bold" + icon). Edits are LIVE on
  `QuickAccessItems` (Office batches until OK; simpler v1 — `Applied` still signals when to
  persist). Subscribes `QuickAccessItems.CollectionChanged` while loaded so a right-click
  add elsewhere refreshes the open dialog.
- **Right-click menus**: `Ribbon.OnContextMenuOpening` override — if the (visual-then-
  logical; `VisualTreeHelper.GetParent` throws on non-visuals like `Run`s, hence the guard)
  ancestor walk from the click finds a `RibbonButton`/`RibbonToggleButton`/
  `RibbonDropDownButton`, it opens: Add to QAT (disabled if already there) / Customize
  Quick Access Toolbar… / Collapse the Ribbon. QAT items are untouched by this path —
  their hosts carry the shared placement menu, which opens (and sets Handled) before the
  event bubbles to the ribbon. That shared menu gained "Remove from Quick Access Toolbar"
  (+ separator, both hidden when the click wasn't on an item) and "Customize…": the hosts'
  `ContextMenuOpening` records which item was clicked into `_qatMenuTarget`
  (`AttachQatContextMenu` wires menu + hook at all three host sites), because the SHARED
  menu's Opened event alone can't tell.
- **`Ribbon.QuickAccessCustomizeRequested`** event: raised by both "Customize…" items; the
  app opens its merged dialog (RibbonKit doesn't open a dialog itself — the app owns it, so
  IT decides which pages exist).
- Showcase: View → Application → **Options** button; both entry points open the same dialog
  (an app "Editor" demo page + the QAT page; the right-click path pre-selects the QAT page);
  `Applied` sets the status bar to "Options applied".
- **Deferred (design sketched, not built):** the "Customize the Ribbon" structure page —
  tab show/hide checkboxes (→ `tab.Visibility`), tab/group reordering (the `Tabs` /
  `tab.Groups` observable collections already support `Move`; group moves across tabs =
  remove+add, mind single-parent timing à la §3.8), custom tabs/groups, and customization
  persistence (serialize QAT sources + ribbon layout). Slots into the dialog as just
  another `RibbonOptionsPage`.

### 3.16 "Customize the Ribbon" structure page

`Controls/RibbonCustomizePage.cs` — the second built-in dialog page (the §3.15 sketch,
built). Layout mirrors Word: available commands (left) | Add/Remove | structure TreeView
(right: tabs → groups → commands, checkbox = tab visibility) | Up/Down, with New Tab /
New Group / Rename under the tree. Implements `IRibbonFillPage`.

- **Office-consistent rules** (they keep customization reversible): reorder anything
  in-parent; hide/show any non-contextual tab EXCEPT the last visible one (the checkbox
  snaps back — note: the refusal notification must be **dispatched**, a synchronous
  `PropertyChanged` inside the setter is swallowed by the binding's reentrancy guard);
  ADD commands only into CUSTOM groups; REMOVE only custom tabs/groups/commands; RENAME
  tabs, groups, and custom (proxy) commands. **Contextual tabs are excluded** from the
  tree — the app drives their visibility (a manual checkbox would fight it).
- **`Ribbon.IsCustom` attached property** marks user-created tabs/groups (the page sets it
  on New Tab/New Group; apps may pre-mark XAML-declared ones to make them user-editable).
  Custom entries display an "(Custom)" suffix like Office. New custom groups get a
  vertical-`WrapPanel` items panel so Medium proxies wrap into 3-row columns instead of
  the default StackPanel overflowing the groups row.
- **Command proxies reused from §3.15**: `CreateQuickAccessProxy` generalized to
  `Ribbon.CreateCommandProxy(source, size)` — Small for the QAT, Medium (icon + label) for
  custom groups. Same invoke/toggle-sync semantics.
- **`RibbonCommandCatalog`** (new, internal): the command discovery/description helpers
  extracted from the QAT page so both pages agree — `CollectControls` (logical-tree walk,
  depth-capped, skips proxies to prevent proxy-of-proxy chains), `CollectAvailable`
  (path-prefixed entries), `Describe` (caption+icon; a renamed proxy shows its own header).
- **Tree mechanics**: `RibbonCustomizeNode` (public, INPC) exposes `IsSelected`/`IsExpanded`
  two-way bound via `TreeViewItem` `ItemContainerStyle` — that's what lets the page
  re-select the moved/renamed/added item after each full tree rebuild (rebuild-per-edit is
  deliberate: trees are small, incremental sync isn't worth it). Custom groups list their
  `Items` directly (mutable: add/remove/reorder = `Items` ops); built-in groups show their
  commands via the catalog walk **read-only** (they live inside arbitrary panels, so
  `Items`-level ops are impossible — also why command reorder is custom-groups-only).
- **`Ribbon.RibbonCustomizeRequested`** event + "Customize the Ribbon…" in the ribbon
  right-click menu (next to the QAT one). Showcase: third dialog page "Customize Ribbon";
  both right-click entries open the dialog pre-selected on the matching page.
- **Still deferred:** persistence (serialize layout + QAT; enables Reset/Import/Export),
  drag-drop in the tree, moving groups across tabs.

**Round 2 (user-verified round 1, then requested):**

- **Proxy label fix:** small-sized sources (B/I/U) have no `Header`, so Medium/Large proxies
  were label-less. Proxies now derive a label from the ScreenTip title with the trailing
  "(Ctrl+B)"-style shortcut stripped (`StripShortcutSuffix`) — label "Bold", tooltip keeps
  the full title. Proxies also copy `LargeIcon` now (needed for the Large layout).
- **`RibbonGroup.Layout`** (DP + `RibbonGroupLayout` enum): `Default` (content-driven, never
  forces anything — built-ins safe), `Stacked` (vertical-wrap panel → 3-row columns;
  items Medium/Small), `Large` (horizontal row; items forced Large). Setting it swaps the
  ItemsPanel and normalizes direct items' sizes (`NormalizeItemSize`: Large layout → Large;
  Stacked demotes Large→Medium, preserves Medium/Small). New custom groups set `Stacked`
  explicitly (the enum's `Default` default means the change callback fires). Add-command
  proxies size to the target group's layout.
- **Edit dialog** (`RibbonCustomizeEditDialog`, replaces the cramped inline rename row —
  the "Edit…" button under the tree): a small `SizeToContent=Height` modal with the same
  chrome recipe as the options dialog (white close-only title bar, DWM rounded corners).
  Per-target sections: name (always; built-in tabs/groups = name-only, like Office);
  custom groups add an **icon picker harvested from the ribbon's own icons**
  (`RibbonCommandCatalog.CollectIcons`, + "no icon"; user-chosen: self-contained over
  app-supplied) and the **layout choice** (Stacked/Large — user chose the two-layout set);
  custom-group commands add **button size** (Medium/Small), shown locked to "Large" when
  the group's layout is Large. Office fun fact honored: Office's own "Rename" dialog for
  custom groups is secretly this (it has a symbol picker).
  - **Sizing fix (user-hit):** `SizeToContent=Height` + `WindowStyle=None` + WindowChrome
    **collapsed the dialog width** to ~nothing (WPF mis-measures a custom-chrome window's
    size). Replaced with a fixed `Width=460` and a `Height` derived in `OnSourceInitialized`
    from which sections are enabled (base + icon/layout/size adders) — deterministic, no
    SizeToContent.

### 3.17 Customization persistence (serialize / restore / Reset)

`Controls/RibbonCustomizationSerializer.cs` (new, public static) — saves and restores the
user's ribbon customizations as JSON so they survive restarts, and so **Reset / Import /
Export are all just `Apply` of a different string**. Two entry points: `Serialize(ribbon)
→ string` and `Apply(ribbon, json)`.

- **Stable identity via `Ribbon.CommandId`** (new attached string property): the whole
  scheme keys off a stable id. Proxies don't survive a restart, so a saved "custom group
  contains Bold" persists Bold's **source id** (`cmd.bold`), and `Apply` recreates the proxy
  via `CreateCommandProxy(source, size)`. Custom tabs/groups created in the page auto-get a
  generated id (`"custom:" + Guid.N`). Built-in **tabs/groups** without an id are left alone
  (not serialized, never touched by `Apply`) so an app opts into tab/group persistence
  incrementally.
- **Command tagging is OPTIONAL (`BuildIdentity`)**: a command need NOT carry an explicit
  `CommandId` to be addable to a custom group and survive restart. `BuildIdentity` walks the
  ribbon once and keys every command under BOTH its explicit id (when set) AND an auto-derived
  path id (`auto:tabKey/groupKey/caption#index`, where tab/group keys prefer their CommandId
  then fall back to header). Serialize writes the preferred id (explicit else auto); `Apply`'s
  `sources` map registers both forms, so either resolves. Explicit ids are still better (stable
  across built-in renames/reorders); the auto id is the fallback. **This was the fix for
  "custom-group items don't persist"** — the first cut silently dropped any proxy whose source
  wasn't hand-tagged, and most showcase commands weren't. The per-group index stays stable
  because custom groups are all-proxy and the catalog skips proxies, so they contribute no
  controls to the walk.
- **What's captured** (`RibbonLayoutDto`): per non-contextual tab — id, IsCustom, header,
  visibility, and its groups; per group — id, IsCustom, header, `Layout`, and (custom only)
  an `IconCommandId` + the proxy commands (each = source id + header + size); plus the QAT
  as an ordered list of `Ref` ids (a proxy persists its source's id; a hand-declared QAT
  item persists its own id). Contextual tabs and id-less built-ins are skipped.
- **Icon persistence without serializing pixels**: a custom group's `Icon` is matched
  (`ReferenceEquals`) against a `CommandId → ImageSource` lookup harvested from the ribbon,
  stored as that command's id, and re-resolved on load. Icons never leave the app; the JSON
  carries only ids.
- **Full-reconcile `Apply`** (robust from ANY starting state — that's what makes Reset
  trivial): (1) catalog current identity → live elements from the CURRENT ribbon (the
  catalog **excludes proxies**, so `sources` holds only real commands + declared QAT items);
  (2) strip every custom tab/group back to the built-in skeleton; (3) rebuild the desired
  tab list — create custom tabs, re-find built-in ones by id, set visibility/header, and
  reconcile each tab's groups (create custom groups + their proxies, rename built-ins);
  (4) reorder tabs to match, appending any current tab the layout didn't mention (a
  newly-shipped built-in, a contextual tab) at the end — so unknown/contextual content is
  preserved, not destroyed; (5) rebuild the QAT in saved order. **Missing ids are skipped;
  a corrupt/foreign string is caught (`JsonException`) and leaves the ribbon as-is.**
- **Reset wired into the page**: `RibbonCustomizePage` gains a `ResetLayout` string DP + a
  `PART_ResetButton` (bottom-left of the template, like Office). The host passes the
  **baseline** it captured at startup; clicking Reset does `Apply(ribbon, ResetLayout)` then
  rebuilds the tree. The button disables when no baseline is supplied.
- **Showcase round-trip** (`MainWindow`): on `Loaded`, **capture the baseline first**
  (`Serialize` the factory ribbon — this is the Reset target, so it must precede any restore),
  then `Apply` the saved JSON from
  `%LocalAppData%\RibbonKitShowcase\ribbon-customization.json` if present. The options
  dialog's `Applied` event (raised on OK) writes the current `Serialize` back to that file.
  All the showcase's tabs/groups + the key commands (Paste/Cut/Copy/Format Painter, B/I/U,
  Find/Replace/Select, Table/Pictures/Link, Zoom/Options) and the three QAT buttons now
  carry `rk:Ribbon.CommandId`s so they're addable and round-trip.
- **Ordering invariant**: baseline capture MUST run before restore, and `Apply`'s
  proxy-excluding `sources` walk is what lets Reset work *after* customization (the custom
  proxies are ignored; Bold is re-found in its built-in Font group). Import/Export are not
  yet surfaced in the UI but are one `Apply`/`Serialize` call away.

## 4. Workflow / Session Conventions

- Cloud workspace: `/home/user/ribbonkit/`. The user's machine:
  `C:\Users\LENOVO\Claude\Projects\Professional Ribbon Custom Control for WPF\`
  (device `brin-mm-2026-0004`).
- **No WPF build available in the Linux sandbox** — every change ships unbuilt; the
  user builds/tests on Windows and reports back. Deliver files via SendUserFile when
  the device bridge is offline (it has been, lately); push directly when connected.
- The user prefers: concise explanations, minimal-formatting replies, files delivered
  immediately, and "just update your side + reply 'Got it'" for their own edits.
- User's own edits so far: `UseLayoutRounding="True"` on the showcase RibbonWindow
  (fixes blurriness); tab-switch slide direction Bottom→Top; backstage open changed
  fade→slide-from-left; document panel margin 14→`8,8,8,0` (aligns the panel edges with
  the ribbon card's inner edge: 7px card margin + 1px border).

## 5. Current State & Next Steps

**Working and confirmed by user: everything through §3.15** — including the QAT
customization + merged options dialog with all its refinements (custom close-only title
bar, DWM rounded corners, resizable, per-page scroll policy via `IRibbonFillPage`), plus
everything previously confirmed (Mica suite, tab-flicker fix, ComboBox height, document-
editor layout).

Still to check: the §3.14 XAML **design-time** preview (active tab + backstage) on the
VS/Blend surface — a designer-only check (does the designer honor the `d:` attributes and
render the design host); and §3.16 **round 2** (the round-1 page itself is user-verified):
proxy labels from small sources, the Edit… dialog (name/icon/layout/size per target),
group layout switching Stacked↔Large with size normalization, and add-proxy sizing in
Large-layout groups.

Also to check (§3.17, just built): customization **persistence** — restart the showcase
and confirm added custom tabs/groups, added commands, renames, tab hide/reorder, group
icon/layout, and QAT edits all survive; that **Reset** restores the factory ribbon from any
state; and that a deleted/corrupt JSON file just starts clean.

Backlog (rough priority):

1. Import/Export UI: surface the §3.17 `Serialize`/`Apply` as file-picker buttons in the
   customize page (the serializer already supports it; only the buttons + file dialogs are
   missing). Drag-drop in the tree and moving groups across tabs also remain.
2. Remaining animations: hover cross-fade, true sliding tab marker (shared animated
   underline on the tab strip), contextual-tab appear, KeyTip badge pop, toggle-state,
   theme-switch cross-fade.
3. Mica hardening (future): dark-mode-aware translucency. (Maximize-with-glass and the
   glass-frame border fix are verified — see §3.12.)
4. Office2010 / Office2007 themes (roadmap Phase 6).
5. Dark mode (2019 white-tab note in §3.6 anticipates it).
6. GitHub publish: repo URL placeholder in csproj (`YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`).
